1. Core Functionality
Bill Split Request Management:  
Create, retrieve, update, and cancel bill split requests.  
Store and manage bill details (e.g., total amount, merchant name, date).
Image Processing:  
Accept bill and group images from the banking app.  
Forward images to an AI service for processing (bill data extraction and face recognition).  
Handle AI callbacks and update the database with results.
Participant Management:  
Manage participant lists (add, remove, update).  
Identify banking users vs. non-banking users.  
Track payment status per participant.
Split Calculation:  
Support multiple split methods: equal, custom amount, percentage.  
Calculate amounts owed by each participant.
Payment Management:  
Send payment requests to participants (in-app for banking users, links/QR codes for others).  
Process payment updates via webhooks from bankingâ€™s payment system.  
Allow manual marking of payments (e.g., offline payments).
Notifications:  
Send real-time notifications (e.g., payment requests, reminders, completion).  
Support multiple channels: in-app (banking users), SMS, email (non-banking users).
Status and Reporting:  
Track bill split request statuses (e.g., created, active, completed).  
Provide status history and basic reports (e.g., paid vs. unpaid amounts).
2. Inputs and Outputs
Inputs:  
Bill image (for AI to extract total amount, merchant, date, etc.).  
Group image (for AI to identify participants via face recognition).
Outputs:  
Split plan with amounts per participant.  
Payment statuses for each participant.
3. Integrations
AI Service (Internal):  
Send bill and group images for processing.  
Receive callbacks with bill details and participant lists.  
Note: For development, mock this service with dummy responses (e.g., hardcoded bill data and participant lists).
banking Payment System:  
Create payment requests and generate payment links/QR codes.  
Receive webhook updates for payment statuses.  
Note: Mock this system for testing (e.g., simulate payment creation and updates)
